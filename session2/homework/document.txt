A Boolean value is either true or false.
In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Python type is bool
A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value. For example
>>> 5 == (3 + 2)  # Is five equal 5 to the result of 3 + 2?
True
>>> 5 == 8
False
>>> j = "hel"
>>> j + "lo" == "hello"
True
