1.A Boolean value is either true or false.
In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Python type is bool
A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value. For example
>>> 5 == (3 + 2)  # Is five equal 5 to the result of 3 + 2?
True
>>> 5 == 8
False
>>> j = "hel"
>>> j + "lo" == "hello"
True
2. To design an algorithm you can draw a flowchart or write pseudo-code
Your algorithm (flowchart or pseudo-code) can then be converted by a programmer using the programming language of their choice (e.g Python)
Each shape has a specific use:
oval: start / end
parallelogram: input / output
ectangle: calculations
diamond: selection structures

if name == "Anh Quan":
    print("Hand some")
elif name == "Minh Duc":
    even_more_handsome = True
else:

webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY")

3. There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.

In a nested if construct, you can have an if...elif...else construct inside another if...elif...else construct.

Example
var = 100
if var < 200:
   print "Expression value is less than 200"
   if var == 150:
      print "Which is 150"
   elif var == 100:
      print "Which is 100"
   elif var == 50:
      print "Which is 50"
   elif var < 50:
      print "Expression value is less than 50"
else:
   print "Could not find true expression"

print "Good bye!"
